Below is a display of the adverse reactions of nitisinone in these studies.Nitisinone was studied in one open-label, uncontrolled study of 207 patients with HT-1, ages 0 to 22 years at enrollment (median age 9 months), who were diagnosed with HT-1 by the presence of succinylacetone in the urine or plasma. The starting dose of nitisinone was 0.3 to 0.5 mg/kg twice daily, and the dose was increased in some patients to 1 mg/kg twice daily based on weight, biochemical, and enzyme markers. The recommended starting dosage of NITYR is 0.5 mg/kg twice daily[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Median duration of treatment was 22 months (range 0.1 to 80 months).The most serious adverse reactions reported during nitisinone treatment were thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, porphyria, and ocular/visual complaints associated with elevated tyrosine levels[seeWarnings and Precautions (5.1,5.2)]. Fourteen patients experienced ocular/visual events. The duration of the symptoms varied from 5 days to 2 years. Six patients had thrombocytopenia, three of which had platelet counts 30,000/microL or lower. In 4 patients with thrombocytopenia, platelet counts gradually returned to normal (duration up to 47 days) without change in the nitisinone dose. No patients developed infections or bleeding as a result of the episodes of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia.Patients with HT-1 are at increased risk of developing porphyric crises, hepatic neoplasms, and liver failure requiring liver transplantation. These complications of HT-1 were observed in patients treated with nitisinone for a median of 22 months during the clinical trial (liver transplantation 13%, liver failure 7%, malignant hepatic neoplasms 5%, benign hepatic neoplasms 3%, porphyria 1%).The most common adverse reactions reported in the clinical trial are summarized in TABLE 1.*reported in at least 1% of patients; ** another oral formulation of nitisinoneTABLE 1Most Common Adverse Reactions*in Patients with HT-1 Treated with Nitisinone**Elevated tyrosine levels>10%Leukopenia3%Thrombocytopenia3%Conjunctivitis2%Corneal Opacity2%Keratitis2%Photophobia2%Eye Pain1%Blepharitis1%Cataracts1%Granulocytopenia1%Epistaxis1%Pruritus1%Exfoliative Dermatitis1%Dry Skin1%Maculopapular Rash1%Alopecia1%Adverse reactions reported in less than 1% of the patients, included death, seizure, brain tumor, encephalopathy, hyperkinesia, cyanosis, abdominal pain, diarrhea, enanthema, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, melena, elevated hepatic enzymes, liver enlargement, hypoglycemia, septicemia, and bronchitis."}, {"header": "7     DRUG INTERACTIONS", "content": "Nitisinone is a moderate CYP2C9 inhibitor, a weak CYP2E1 inducer and an inhibitor of OAT1/OAT3.

Animal reproduction studies have been conducted for nitisinone. In these studies, nitisinone was administered to mice and rabbits during organogenesis with oral doses of nitisinone up to 20 and 8-times respectively, the recommended initial dose of 1 mg/kg/day. In mice, nitisinone caused incomplete skeletal ossification of fetal bones and decreased pup survival at doses 0.4 times the recommended initial dose, and increased gestational length at doses 4 times the recommended initial dose. In rabbits, nitisinone caused maternal toxicity and incomplete skeletal ossification of fetal bones at doses 1.6 times the recommended initial dose(seeData).The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.DataAnimal DataReproduction studies have been performed in mice at oral doses of about 0.4, 4 and 20 times the recommended initial dose (1 mg/kg/day) and in rabbits at oral doses of about 1.6, 4 and 8 times the recommended initial dose based on the body surface area. In mice, nitisinone has been shown to cause incomplete skeletal ossification of fetal bones at 0.4, 4 and 20 times the recommended initial dose, increased gestational length at 4 and 20 times the recommended initial dose, and decreased pup survival at 0.4 times the recommended initial dose based on the body surface area. In rabbits, nitisinone caused incomplete skeletal ossification of fetal bones at 1.6, 4 and 8 times the recommended initial dose based on the body surface area.8.2 LactationRisk SummaryThere are no data on the presence of nitisinone in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Data suggest that nitisinone is present in rat milk due to findings of ocular toxicity and lower body weight seen in drug naive nursing rat pups. The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for NITYR and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from NITYR or from the underlying maternal condition.8.4 Pediatric UseThe safety and effectiveness of nitisinone have been established for the treatment of HT-1 in combination with dietary restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine in pediatric patients. Use of NITYR\u00a0for this indication\u00a0is supported by evidence from one open-label, uncontrolled clinical study conducted with another oral formulation of nitisinone in 207 patients with HT-1 ages 0 to 22 years (median age 9 months)[see Clinical Studies (14)].8.5 Geriatric UseClinical studies of nitisinone did not include any subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. No pharmacokinetic studies of nitisinone have been performed in geriatric patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy in this patient population."}, {"header": "11 DESCRIPTION", "content": "NITYR (nitisinone) is a hydroxyphenyl-pyruvate dioxygenase inhibitor.Nitisinone occurs as a white to yellowish-white, crystalline powder.

The empirical formula is C14H10F3NO5and the molecular weight is 329.23. The structural formula is:Each NITYR (nitisinone) tablet contains 2, 5 or 10 mg of nitisinone. Inactive ingredients are: glyceryl dibehenate, and lactose monohydrate. NITYR tablets are intended for oral administration."}, {"header": "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY", "content": "12.1 Mechanism of ActionNitisinone is a competitive inhibitor of 4-hydroxyphenyl-pyruvate dioxygenase, an enzyme upstream of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) in the tyrosine catabolic pathway. By inhibiting the normal catabolism of tyrosine in patients with HT-1, nitisinone prevents the accumulation of the catabolic intermediates maleylacetoacetate and fumarylacetoacetate. In patients with HT-1, these catabolic intermediates are converted to the toxic metabolites succinylacetone and succinylacetoacetate, which are responsible for the observed liver and kidney toxicity. Succinylacetone can also inhibit the porphyrin synthesis pathway leading to the accumulation of 5-aminolevulinate, a neurotoxin responsible for the porphyric crises characteristic of HT-1.12.2\u00a0PharmacodynamicsIn a clinical study, patients with HT-1 were diagnosed by the presence of succinylacetone in urine or plasma and treated with another oral formulation of nitisinone [see Clinical Studies (14)]. In all 186 patients whose urine succinylacetone was measured, the urinary succinylacetone concentration decreased to less than 1 mmol/mol creatinine, the lower limit of quantitation. The median time to normalization of urine succinylacetone was 0.3 months. The probability of recurrence of abnormal values of urine succinylacetone was 1% at a nitisinone concentration of 37 micromol/L (95% confidence interval: 23, 51 micromol/L). In 87% (150/172) of patients whose plasma succinylacetone was measured, the plasma succinylacetone concentration decreased to less than 0.1 micromol/L, the lower limit of quantitation. The median time to normalization of plasma succinylacetone was 3.9 months.In another study, comparing two dosing regimens of another oral formulation of nitisinone, succinylacetone was measured in urine and/or blood in 16 patients with HT-1 aged 5 years to 24 years. All study patients were on a stable nitisinone daily dosage (0.4 mg/kg/day to 1 mg/kg/day) during both study dosing regimens. After at least 4 weeks of twice daily dosing with nitisinone, both the urine and/or blood succinylacetone concentrations were below the limit of quantitation for the assay. Patients were then switched to once daily dosing with the same total daily dosage of nitisinone and blood and/or urine succinylacetone concentrations remained undetectable when measured following at least 4 weeks of treatment with once daily dosing.Nitisinone inhibits catabolism of the amino acid tyrosine and can result in elevated plasma levels of tyrosine. Therefore, treatment with nitisinone requires restriction of the dietary intake of tyrosine and phenylalanine to prevent the toxicity associated with elevated plasma levels of tyrosine[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].12.3 PharmacokineticsThe single-dose pharmacokinetics of nitisinone have been studied for NITYR tablets in healthy adult subjects.AbsorptionThe pharmacokinetic characteristics following single oral administration of 10 mg NITYR under fasting conditions are shown in TABLE 3.TABLE 3.

The median Tmaxwas delayed to 6 hours under fed conditions[see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].DistributionInvitrobinding of nitisinone to human plasma proteins is greater than 95% at 50 micromolar concentration. For NITYR, the arithmetic mean (SD) apparent volume of distribution of nitisinone is 8.2 (1.6) L in healthy subjects (n=23).EliminationFor NITYR, the arithmetic mean (SD) terminal half-life of nitisinone is 59.3 (8.9) hours in healthy subjects (n=23).Metabolism: In vitrostudies have shown that nitisinone is relatively stable in human liver microsomes with minor metabolism possibly mediated by CYP3A4 enzyme.Excretion:Renal elimination of nitisinone is of minor importance, since the mean of the fraction of dose excreted as unchanged nitisinone in the urine (fe(%)) was 3.0% (n=3) following multiple oral doses of 80 mg daily in healthy subjects. The estimated mean (CV%) renal clearance of nitisinone was 0.003 L/h (25%).Drug Interaction StudiesNitisinone does not inhibit CYP2D6. Nitisinone is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9, and a weak inducer of CYP2E1 (TABLE 4). Nitisinone is an inhibitor of OAT1/3 (TABLE 4).TABLE 4.

Data for historical controls showed that patients presenting with HT-1 between 2 months and 6 months of age treated with dietary restriction alone had 2-and 4-year survival probabilities of 74% and 60%, respectively.The effects of nitisinone on urine and plasma succinylacetone, porphyrin metabolism, and urinary alpha-1-microglobulin were also assessed in this clinical study.Porphyria-like crisis were reported in 3 patients (0.3% of cases per year) during the clinical study. This compares to an incidence of 5 to 20% of cases per year expected as part of the natural history of the disorder. An assessment of porphyria-like crises was performed because these events are commonly reported in patients with HT-1 who are not treated with nitisinone.Urinary alpha-1-microglobulin, a proposed marker of proximal tubular dysfunction, was measured in 100 patients at baseline. The overall median pretreatment level was 4.3 grams/mol creatinine. After one year of treatment in a subgroup of patients (N=100), overall median alpha-1-microglobulin decreased by 1.5 grams/mol creatinine. In patients 24 months of age and younger in whom multiple values were available (N=65), median alpha-1-microglobulin levels decreased from 5 to 3 grams/mol creatinine (reference value for age less than or equal to 12 grams/mol creatinine). In patients older than 24 months in whom multiple values were available (N=35), median alpha-1-microglobulin levels decreased from 2.8 to 2 grams/mol creatinine (reference for age less than or equal to 6 grams/mol creatinine)."}, {"header": "16 HOW SUPPLIED/STORAGE AND HANDLING", "content": "How SuppliedNITYR (nitisinone) tablet is white to beige, round, flat which may display light yellow to brown speckles, debossed with the \u201cstrength\u201d in mg on one side and \u201cL\u201d on the other side.
