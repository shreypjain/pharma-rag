Therefore, treatment with ORFADIN may cause an increase in plasma tyrosine levels in patients with HT-1. Maintain concomitant reduction in dietary tyrosine and phenylalanine while on ORFADIN treatment. Do not adjust ORFADIN dosage in order to lower the plasma tyrosine concentration. Maintain plasma tyrosine levels below 500 micromol/L. Inadequate restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine intake can lead to elevations in plasma tyrosine levels and levels greater than 500\u00a0micromol/L may lead to the following:Ocular signs and symptoms including corneal ulcers, corneal opacities, keratitis, conjunctivitis, eye pain, and photophobia have been reported in patients treated with ORFADIN[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In a clinical study in a non HT-1 population without dietary restriction and reported tyrosine levels >500 micromol/L  both symptomatic and asymptomatic keratopathies have been observed.

The starting dose of ORFADIN was 0.3 to 0.5 mg/kg twice daily, and the dose was increased in some patients to 1 mg/kg twice daily based on weight, biochemical, and enzyme markers. The recommended starting dosage of  ORFADIN is 0.5 mg/kg twice daily[see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Median duration of treatment was 22 months (range 0.1 to 80 months).The most serious adverse reactions reported during ORFADIN treatment were thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, porphyria, and ocular/visual complaints associated with elevated tyrosine levels[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1,5.2)]. Fourteen patients experienced ocular/visual events. The duration of the symptoms varied from 5 days to 2 years.  Six patients had thrombocytopenia, three of which had platelet counts 30,000/microL or lower. In 4 patients with thrombocytopenia, platelet counts gradually returned to normal (duration up to 47 days) without change in ORFADIN dose.  No patients developed infections or bleeding as a result of the episodes of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia.Patients with HT-\u00a01 are at increased risk of developing porphyric crises, hepatic neoplasms, and liver failure requiring liver transplantation.

Animal reproduction studies have been conducted for nitisinone.  In these studies, nitisinone was administered to mice and rabbits during organogenesis with oral doses of nitisinone up to 20 and 8 times respectively, the recommended initial dose of 1 mg/kg/day. In mice, nitisinone caused incomplete skeletal ossification of fetal bones and decreased pup survival at doses 0.4 times the recommended initial dose, and increased gestational length at doses 4 times the recommended initial dose.  In rabbits, nitisinone caused maternal toxicity and incomplete skeletal ossification of fetal bones at doses 1.6 times the recommended initial dose[seeData].The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.DataAnimal DataReproduction studies have been performed in mice at oral doses of about 0.4, 4 and 20 times the recommended initial dose (1 mg/kg/day) and in rabbits at oral doses of about 1.6, 4 and 8 times the recommended initial dose based on the body surface area. In mice, nitisinone has been shown to cause incomplete skeletal  ossification of fetal bones at 0.4, 4 and 20 times the recommended initial dose, increased gestational length at 4 and 20 times the recommended initial dose, and decreased pup survival at 0.4 times the recommended initial dose based on the body surface area. In rabbits, nitisinone caused incomplete skeletal ossification of fetal bones at 1.6, 4 and 8 times the recommended initial dose based on the body surface area.8.2 LactationRisk SummaryThere are no data on the presence of nitisinone in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production.  Data suggest that nitisinone is present in rat milk due to findings of ocular toxicity and lower body weight seen in drug naive nursing rat pups.  The development and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for ORFADIN and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ORFADIN or from the underlying maternal condition.8.4 Pediatric UseThe safety and effectiveness of ORFADIN have been established in pediatric patients for the treatment of HT-1 in combination with dietary restriction of tyrosine and phenylalanine.  Use of ORFADIN in pediatric patients is supported by evidence from one open-label, uncontrolled clinical study conducted in 207 patients with HT-1 ages 0 to 22 years (median age 9 months)[see Clinical Studies (14)].8.5 Geriatric UseClinical studies of nitisinone did not include any subjects aged 65 and over.

By inhibiting the normal catabolism of tyrosine in patients with HT-1, nitisinone prevents the accumulation of the catabolic intermediates maleylacetoacetate and fumarylacetoacetate. In patients with HT-1, these catabolic intermediates are converted to the toxic metabolites succinylacetone and succinylacetoacetate, which are responsible for the observed liver and kidney toxicity. Succinylacetone can also inhibit the porphyrin synthesis pathway leading to the accumulation of 5-aminolevulinate, a neurotoxin responsible for the porphyric crises characteristic of HT-1.12.2 PharmacodynamicsIn a clinical study, patients with HT-1 were diagnosed by the presence of succinylacetone in urine or plasma and treated with ORFADIN[see Clinical Studies (14)]. In all 186 patients whose urine succinylacetone was measured, the urinary succinylacetone concentration decreased to less than 1 mmol/mol creatinine, the lower limit of  quantitation. The median time to normalization of urine succinylacetone was 0.3 months.  The probability of recurrence of abnormal values of urine succinylacetone was 1% at a nitisinone concentration of 37 micromol/L (95% confidence interval: 23, 51 micromol/L).  In 87% (150/172) of patients whose plasma succinylacetone was measured, the plasma succinylacetone concentration decreased to less than 0.1 micromol/L, the lower limit of quantitation. The median time to normalization of plasma succinylacetone was 3.9 months.In another study, comparing two dosing regimens, succinylacetone was measured in urine and/or blood in 16 patients with HT-1 aged 5 years to 24 years. All study patients were on a stable ORFADIN daily dosage (0.4 mg/kg/day to 1 mg/kg/day) during both study dosing regimens.  After at least 4 weeks of twice daily dosing with ORFADIN, both the urine and/or blood succinylacetone concentrations  were below the limit of quantitation for the assay.  Patients were then switched to once daily dosing with the same total daily dosage of ORFADIN and blood and/or urine succinylacetone concentrations remained undetectable when measured following at least 4 weeks of treatment with once daily dosing.Nitisinone inhibits catabolism of the amino acid tyrosine and can result in elevated plasma levels of tyrosine. Therefore, treatment with nitisinone requires restriction of the dietary intake of tyrosine and phenylalanine to prevent the toxicity associated with elevated plasma levels of tyrosine[see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].12.3 PharmacokineticsThe single-dose pharmacokinetics of nitisinone have been studied for both ORFADIN capsules and ORFADIN oral suspension in healthy adult subjects and the multiple-dose pharmacokinetics have been studied for ORFADIN capsules in healthy subjects.AbsorptionThe pharmacokinetic characteristics following single oral administration of ORFADIN 30 mg under fasting conditions are shown inTable 3.  Compared to ORFADIN capsule, the median Tmaxoccurred about 3 hours earlier with ORFADIN oral suspension. The multiple-dose characteristics of ORFADIN 80 mg once daily are shown inTable 4.

Patients were diagnosed with HT-1 by the presence of succinylacetone in the urine or plasma. All patients were treated with ORFADIN at a starting dose of 0.3 to 0.5 mg/kg twice daily, and the dose was increased in some patients to 1 mg/kg twice daily based on weight, liver and kidney function tests, platelet count, serum amino acids, urinary phenolic acid, plasma and urine succinylacetone, erythrocyte PBG-synthase, and urine 5-ALA. The median duration of treatment was 22 months (range less than 1 month to 80 months). Efficacy was assessed by comparison of survival and incidence of liver transplant to historical controls.For patients presenting with HT-1 younger than 2 months of age who were treated with dietary restriction and nitisinone, 2- and 4-year survival probabilities were 88% and 88%, respectively. Data from historical controls showed that patients presenting with HT-1 at younger than 2 months of age  and treated with dietary restriction alone had 2- and 4-year survival probabilities of 29% and 29%, respectively. For patients presenting with HT-1 between 2 months and 6 months of age who were treated with dietary restriction and nitisinone, 2- and 4-year survival probabilities were 94% and 94%, respectively. Data for historical controls showed that patients presenting with HT-1 between 2 months and 6 months of age treated with dietary restriction alone had 2- and 4-year survival probabilities of 74% and 60%, respectively.The effects of nitisinone on urine and plasma succinylacetone, porphyrin metabolism, and urinary alpha-1-microglobulin were also assessed in this clinical study.Porphyria-like crisis were reported in 3 patients (0.3% of cases per year) during the clinical study. This compares to an incidence of 5 to 20% of cases per year expected as part of the natural history of the disorder. An assessment of porphyria-like crises was performed because these events are commonly reported in patients with HT-1 who are not treated with nitisinone.Urinary alpha-1-microglobulin, a proposed marker of proximal tubular dysfunction, was measured in 100 patients at baseline. The overall median pretreatment level was 4.3 grams/mol creatinine.
